# Pokemon TCG Card Search! (Cardpedia)

Why hello there trainer! Are you perhaps in the need of a search engine, because you forgot what a card does?

Well you just so happen to have arrive at a far corner of the internet to find...

**CARDPEDIA!!**

## What exactly is Cardpedia?

Well fellow trainer. Cardpedia is the only site you can use for searching cards...
*No it's not just trying to sell my point here :b*

You can search from all sorts of cards. From the earlier times from when Pokemon TCG as existed and to the latest releases!

In face you can even look up all sorts of calls. From pokemon, trainer cards, and maybe some random cards if you feeling lucky~!

## How exactly do I use this?

That's easy! All you have to do is first!

- Click the link of the site [Cardpedia](https://pedrocr05.surge.sh) *I actually don't have the site ready sooo uhhh yeah... :)*

- When on the webpage you will be greeted with four things. First the search button, How to search menu, Card list, and Card sets!

- I recommend looking at the how to search, but since you're here. There is no need for that~!

- Next, card sets! If you are confused or unsure what card sets there are in the pokemon TCG? Well no problemo! I got your back trainer! *Also beware... it's a VERY long list... Sorry!*

- Now once you've decided you're *favorite* choice words from the best list ever~! Just go ahead and drop that into sentence into the wonderful words of *Search a card?* Once you do go ahead and click on that search button! :D

- Woah! Another list! Yay! *I swear I tried to make it smaller, sorry if the cards is even longer not sure though but good luck~! o7* Once you find you're favorite pocket monster. You can click on it and it will bring you the wonderful data of the card!

# Wait but what if I want to change cards?

- R-right! *ahem* Just search the name again! Don't worry the set name for the cards will not be removed so you can just spam that search button until it falls off! *I'd be worried if it does fall off though...*

### Final notes...

Hello, my name is Pedro and I want to say this project was both easy and challenging in *so* many ways.

Though on thing I did enjoy during this project is seeing myself understanding certain lines of code from having no idea what I'm typing to having like the slightest idea... *Ok, yes it's not much but* It is for me!

As you can notice right below the wire framing. Yeah... maybe I was a little ambitious, but I blame myself.
I will for sure be more careful with my project resources, data, and just anything I will use.

It hurt sadly that I had to swap ideas mid way. Was looking forward to my higher or lower but maybe in the future!

Thank you for reading and I hope my 3 days worth of work didn't make you cringe... *too much :b*

The after math of what felt somewhat defeated but in the end I learned a valuable lesson and I got to learn more about CSS codes. Most importantly *FINALLY* starting to understand grids~!
