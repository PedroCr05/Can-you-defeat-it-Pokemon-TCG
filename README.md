# Pok√©mon TCG - Minigames!

## Description
Hello there trainer!
Are you perphaps in the mood of feeling the same spark you once had when you first had your pokemon ball?

Well! You've arrive at a great time! 
(It's not a gaurentee so don't sue me)
I have a few minigames just for you! Can you beat these -trails- games?
I heard if you beat all (x number of whatever I compelete)
Something special might happen! 
Perphaps 1 billion poke money?
Maybe a shiny legendary encounter?
Or just maybe...
A intersting thing, BUT if you're the best of the best!? 
Then why do you proof it through these games?

# Higher or Lower?
What is this game?
Well, as many of you already aware of how higher or lower works.
In this case the higher or lower will be for the pokedex entry!
So if your card is higher than the oppsoing card in the dex number then you press higher!
Now what if you get it wrong?
Well 

# Can you guess that fact?

# Are you the very best?
