# PokÃ©mon TCG - Minigames!

Hello there *trainer!*

Are you perphaps in the mood of feeling the same spark you once had when you first had your pokemon battle?

*Well!* You've arrive at a great time!
(It's not a gaurentee that you will feel that same spark so don't sue me!)

I have a few minigames just for you! Can you beat these ~~*trails*~~ games!

Also I heard, *if* you beat **all** *(x number of whatever I compelete)* minigames...
*Something special might happen!*

Perphaps *1 billion poke dollars?*
Maybe a **shiny legendary** encounter?
Or just *maybe...*

*A intersting thing,* **BUT** if you're the best of the best.
Then why do you prove it through these games?

# THE MINIGAMES! 

## Higher or Lower?

What is this game?

*Well,* as many of you already aware of how **HIGHER** or *lower* works.

In case, if you don't!
**HIGHER** or *lower* is a game where you guess whether a card has a higher value number than the opposing item!
*Usually,* it's sometimes with random objects with a number but here, it's a little *different~!*

In this case, the **HIGHER** or *lower* will be from the pokedex entry!

So, if your card is **Higher** than the oppsoing card in the **dex number** then you press **HIGHER!**

Now what *if* you get it wrong?

*Well,* you have up to **3** chances, before you lose your *all* points.

*The more points you get.*
**The faster the timer goes down~.**

*Oh that's right!*
I forgot to mention. There is no cheating here, so you're being *timed.*

Remember! If you're truly **THE** *Champion of the Pokemon World.*

You can **easily** beat this little minigame *right?* 

## Can you guess that fact?

~~CAN YOU GUESS THAT POKEMON?~~
*Ahem.* Sorry, wrong line.

**CAN YOU GUESS THAT FACT?**
*Huh... Not as catchy... Oh well*

Now whether you passed **HIGHER** or *Lower...*

Do you have it in you where you can get the correct fact of your amazing pocket monster?

Welcome~! To the weekly show of a **Pokemon Questionaire!**

Here you will be prompted with a singular question **AND** a *card/pokemon~!*

Now it is up to you whether you can guess the *correct* answer between the four that are prompted just for you~!

*Oh no~*
Watch out! You have only **10 seconds** to answer or you lose your streak!

Every now and then. You *might* get an interesting *event*.
Whether you do get it or not!

Are you up for the *challenge?*

## Are you the very best?

*Well,* I see you've arrived at the near to bottom section.

You might be wondering that same question though...
*Are* **YOU** *the very best?*

To figure that out. Why not play a little *game* with me?
*(This is obviously not how you play the TCG, so put down those pitchforks!)*

You must get **10 total wins** to see something *interesting* in this minigame!

**With 12 cards, 6 singular card rerolls, and 3 lifes.**
Do you think you can best everyone?

If so! Give it a shot!
*Maybe,* you'll be apart of the **Elite four...**
